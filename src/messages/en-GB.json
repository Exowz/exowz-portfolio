        "intro1": "Hi! My name is Mathew Kristoffer Ewan KAPOOR, but I usually go by Ewan. I'm 23 years old and from Mauritius. I'm currently a student at ECE Paris, studying Data & AI Development, so I live in Paris.",
        "intro2": "I'm going to tell you my story. Because beyond the developer I am, beyond this portfolio, there's a real person, full of dreams and ambition.",
        "origins1": "My story begins in March 2002, on a small paradise in the Indian Ocean: Mauritius. I grew up surrounded by loving parents who still support me today. My life was punctuated by the beach, family, my mother's delicious meals, and sports. A simple life, but a happy one.",
        "family": "My parents taught me everything. My mother, a homemaker, passed on the art of organization and awakened my passion for cooking (which is now one of my favorite hobbies!). My father, a mechanical engineer at a thermal power plant, was my first inspiration. He gave me a taste for science, calculations, and always admired France. He's the one who enrolled me in a French school, passing on his love for this country, its culture, and its history.",
        "computer": "In parallel, another passion was growing. I remember the first computer my father gave me at 7 years old: an old HP laptop running Windows XP, his old work PC. I was mesmerized. I took it apart, tinkered, experimented... until I broke it. But my curiosity was piqued. Quickly, I became the family's 'IT guy': I built PCs, managed the router, advised my parents on their purchases. At the time, it was just a hobby; my dream was elsewhere.",
        "dream": "I wanted to be like my father. An engineer, but in nuclear energy, which I believe in. So I charted my course: Scientific Baccalaureate, then departure for France with a well-established plan, heading to preparatory classes for engineering schools.",
        "challenge": "But life had other surprises in store for me.",
        "struggle": "This period was marked by the death of my uncle, to whom I was very close, and other personal issues. This cocktail made me stumble. I didn't succeed in my first year. It was my first real failure, and the shock was brutal. The brilliant high school student I was suddenly felt useless. I decided to return to Mauritius to recharge, but also to help my father, whose health was declining, manage the family business: selling dietary supplements.",
        "introspection": "I stayed in Mauritius for two years. Two years to take an introspective pause, to 'heal' myself mentally and find myself. I managed the company and learned guitar self-taught, to develop that artistic side I felt was a weak point in my purely scientific profile.",
        "return": "After these two years, having not forgotten my initial dream but unable to return to preparatory classes, I discovered ECE's program which allowed me to join in an accelerated semester in March, the first year of their preparatory cycle, so I enrolled. However, the difficulty of resuming such intensive studies surprised me, and I also fell ill around the same time - that year was complicated. However, the director of studies noticed my potential in computer science, having still gotten excellent grades, and suggested I do their bachelor's instead. I took a long time to make a decision because it didn't align with my initial dream, but I finally accepted. And that's when the revelation happened.",
        "revelation": "I understood that it wasn't computer science I didn't like, but the way it was taught to me in prep school. In the Bachelor's program, everything was based on practical cases, innovative projects. My dormant passion woke up all at once.",
        "webdev": "At first, web development fascinated me. It allowed me to express my creativity, to manage a project from A to Z. I'm a great admirer of Apple, for their ability to create products that are innovative, powerful, useful, and beautiful all at once. It's a philosophy I apply to all my projects.",
        "dataAI": "Then, a new subject changed everything: Data and AI.",
        "sovereignty1": "I understood the importance of our data, this 'gold of the 21st century.' I also understood, with dread, how much Europe is lagging behind and dependent. When you realize that 70% of the cloud is owned by AWS or that a Windows update can paralyze airports, it's scary for our independence.",
        "sovereignty2": "And the notion of independence is very important to me. So I'm heading towards this specialization because I want to participate in our independence, European independence! A continent so rich and fabulous, through its history, culture, and civilization cannot be so far behind... That's why I'm now in the world of Data and AI.",
        "closing": "That's all for my presentation, so you know a little better who's behind this computer and who will potentially be your new collaborator. Have a wonderful day and don't hesitate to contact me for various projects!",

This project is more than just a brochure website; it's a digital sanctuary designed to mirror the therapeutic and calming essence of Shiatsu itself, providing a seamless and informative experience for clients seeking holistic health solutions. What truly sets \"Shiatsu Guyane\" apart is its innovative and immersive \"Garden Component System,\" which weaves a consistent botanical theme throughout the user interface, creating a uniquely tranquil digital environment.",
      "challenge": {
        "problem": "In a competitive wellness market, a Shiatsu therapy practice in French Guiana needed a professional, modern, and highly accessible online presence. The challenge was to move beyond generic web templates and build a bespoke platform that accurately conveys the serene and healing nature of Shiatsu, while effectively reaching local clients, providing comprehensive service information, and simplifying communication and potential booking processes.",
        "goal": "The primary objective was to develop a high-performance, responsive, and SEO-optimized website that acts as a central hub for the Shiatsu Guyane practice. Success would be measured by its ability to effectively showcase services, enhance practitioner credibility, facilitate effortless client contact (and eventually booking), and provide a uniquely immersive user experience that reflects the brand's commitment to well-being.",
        "constraints": "Key technical constraints included ensuring lightning-fast loading times and fluid navigation, crucial for retaining user attention and improving SEO, especially in regions with varying internet speeds. Implementing a comprehensive, modular design system, like the \"Garden Components,\" without compromising performance or code maintainability, required careful architectural planning."
      },
      "discovery": {
        "requirements": "The core requirement was to create an online platform for a Shiatsu therapy practice serving prospective clients seeking alternative therapies and existing clients needing easy access to information. Their needs included a calming, trustworthy aesthetic, easy-to-understand content (potentially in French and English), clear calls-to-action for contact, and mobile accessibility for on-the-go browsing.",
        "competitiveAnalysis": "The decision to build a custom, Next.js-powered site with a unique aesthetic suggests a desire to stand out from generic, template-based websites often used by small businesses. Many wellness sites lack deep SEO integration, responsive design excellence, or a distinct brand identity. This project aimed to leverage modern web technologies to surpass common limitations.",
        "technicalResearch": "The choice of Next.js 15 with the App Router was foundational, driven by its reputation for superior performance, built-in SEO capabilities, and efficient server-side rendering.
